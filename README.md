# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of Analysis

The PyBer analysis is presented with a miltiple line graph showing weekly fares for each type of city. The listed city types are urban,suburban and rural. 

## Results

There is a trend between the population of city, and the total fares. In the Urban cities the total rides is highest including total fares. The easily accesible rides in the urban cities also bing the average fares per ride down as it is easily accessible.

With the multiple-line chart, we are able to compare total fares by city type over a period of five months. The number of rides seem peak at the end of February and fluctuates during the month of March. All the graphs tend to follow the same trend throughout these months, except for the trend in suburban cities, where we see a sharper increase during the month of April.

## Summary
### Business recommendations for the disparities
1. Research into what is causing the increses between mid Feb into March. Also in Urban and Rural cities there is a sharp increase in April but a sharp decrease in the Suburban cities. 
2. Allocate more drivers in the Rural cities, the decrease of fares could be because they are not as accessible as they are in Urban cities. 
3. Lastly, we know that average fare per ride and driver is higher when there are less drivers. With this information, the company can influence ride-share prices by limiting or increasing the number of drivers during a certain time to achieve its profit goal.
